       "Imagine for a moment: You have an exciting project to make Zürich more sustainable.
      You have very little resources – maybe you are a startup just overwhelmed
      with the logistics of starting up at all.  Or maybe you are new to
      Zurich. Or maybe you are from a marginalized community.  Whatever it is,
      you are at a disadvantage."
       [:br]
       "There likely is someone in the city who can help you get up to speed and share lessons learned the hard way.
      But finding these people and organizations takes time and resources you
      do not have.  So, you will unnecessarily duplicate efforts by others and
      fail in predictable ways.  This is not only a problem for you, but also a
      problem for society at large. Urban sustainability needs everyone, from
      every sector. This means that urban sustainability needs connections. It
      needs strong governance networks."
       [:br]
       [:br]
       "In SDGNets@ZH, we are building an automated way to monitor \"who is doing what?\" in urban sustainability to help out with this problem.
      To do so, we combine natural language processing with machine learning to
       analyze unstructured text data in regular intervals. We identify topics
       and actors and map them to governance networks."
       [:br]
       "Which is a fancy way of saying that we teach computers to read
       newspapers (mostly) and figure out \"who is doing what?\" at the moment
       when it comes to urban sustainability. Based on this information we
       create a network map, where actors (like civil society organizations,
       businesses or state agencies) are connected to different issues in urban
       sustainability (like sustainable transport, climate-friendly energy
       provision or urban biodiversity)."

       "Glad you asked. It's absolutely the right question. To get a snapshot
       over \"who is doing what (potentially with whom)?\" it's very likely we
       would get a better impression by just talking to some people. Which
       we'll do, to see that the computers don't produce nonsense."

              good at scaling up - so someone can use our approach as a staring
              point for mapping in another city."]]

        augment the mapping with a citizen science component as well."]

      "We will follow an iterative approach in developing the mapping, starting
       from working prototypes of smaller scope (for example only using a
       specific issue of urban sustainability, such as sustainable transport).
       We then plan to gradually expand the scope of the mapping in interaction
       with stakeholders. "
