network interventions with stakeholders to close governance gaps in a
real-world experiment. Governance gaps describe a lack of coordination among
actors working on interrelated problems. Combining the crowd-sourced model of
SDG interactions with our actor network mapping enables us to identify
governance gaps, using multi-level network models."

       "While more nuanced in practice, the central hypothesis and motivation
behind multi-level governance network research can be put quite simply: If two
problems are related, it is likely beneficial if actors working on these
problems coordinated their actions. If actors work on interrelated
problems (such as specific SDGs) but are not coordinating their actions, there
is a governance gap or misfit in the network, detrimental to successful
outcomes."

around two questions:"

implementation in Zurich?"

to improving SDG implementation processes?"

       "Multi-level network modeling connecting actors and localized SDG
interactions to diagnose gaps in urban SDG implementation is a straightforward
conceptual extension to existing research. To identify and classify governance
gaps (RQ3.1), we rely on multi-level motif analysis."
       [:br]
       "For RQ3.2, we co-design network interventions with actors in
participatory processes. These interventions bring together actors involved in
governance gaps to promote social learning or spark new projects. To assess the
potential of such network modeling based, relatively high-effort interventions,
we compare their outcomes with a matched control group where actors receive
low-effort digital prompts about potential network partners over a period of
time."]
